This is the link to GSAP page for installation - https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/?tab=cdn&module=esm&method=private+registry&tier=free&club=false&require=false&trial=true&plugins=ScrollTrigger
You need to use CDN tab for the HTML projects 
This is the link to GSAP ScrollTrigger page - https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollTrigger/?page=1
It was a bit tricky to create ScrollTrigger animation for the item with the same class name, but located in the different parts of the page. Please refer to the JS file to see how this issue was resolved.
